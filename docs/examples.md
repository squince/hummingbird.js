Yep, you can even run this from the command-line.  This can be useful if
making changes to the code or if you simply want to experiment with the
data you are indexing or configuration parameters.

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/glg/hummingbird.js) or pull down
   just this
   [subdirectory](https://github.com/glg/hummingbird.js/tree/master/examples)
    
1. _$ npm install_

    from inside the ./coffee-repl subdirectory

1. _$ coffee repl.coffee_

    to disk, and displays interactive query prompt
