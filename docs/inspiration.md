## Inspiration

Inspired by the desire to help folks _get to_ what they want
_without leaving_ what they're doing.  Hummingbird's
goals are simple:

* Unlike other search solutions, focus strictly on names of
persons, places, and things for autocomplete, autosuggest,
and typeahead applications
* Prioritize speed and simplicity
* Enable finding near matches (e.g., substring matches, misspellings, nicknames)

To do this we decided to push as much processing as possible to the
browser and eliminate the latency and architectural complexity
introduced by server-side solutions.
